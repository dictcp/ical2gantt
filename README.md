# ical2gantt
renders an ical file as a gantt chart in the browser

1. replace the calendar.ics file with yours (e.g. download from UCI's EEE website)
2. run the server with `./server` (requires python, basically just a static file server)
3. launch http://localhost:8000 and see the rendered gantt chart
